# Third-party notices

Human-maintained attribution notices for third-party content that ships inside an SM artifact and carries a notice
obligation. This is **not** the licence report: the generated per-dependency report is `THIRD-PARTY-shipped.txt` and
`THIRD-PARTY-test.txt`, produced under `target/` by the `add-third-party` goals (see [`README.md`](README.md), the
licence gate, `REQ-014` / `I8`). The generated report lists declared dependency licences; it cannot list data files a
jar bundles inside itself, so those are recorded here.

Each entry names the artifact, the exact version, the bundled file, the ruling that approved it, and the notice text the
licence requires to travel with copies.

## `com.networknt:json-schema-validator:2.0.8` (Apache-2.0) bundled data tables

Approved by owner ruling `OR-87` ([`../docs/design/DECISIONS.md`](../docs/design/DECISIONS.md)), by exact coordinate
and version, as bundled data inside a shipped Apache-2.0 artifact. Found by plan 010 T3.0's bundled-content check
([`../docs/tasks/t3-0-json-schema-library.md`](../docs/tasks/t3-0-json-schema-library.md)). **Neither file is read at
runtime** (the package schema uses no `format`; the files back the `idn-hostname` and `idn-email` formats). A bump of this
artifact needs the same check repeated and a new line in `licence-exceptions.txt`.

### 1. `ucd/extracted/DerivedJoiningType.txt` -- Unicode License V3

A Unicode Character Database file (`DerivedJoiningType-15.0.0.txt`, dated 2022-04-26). Its own header reads
"(c) 2022 Unicode(R), Inc." and refers to <https://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html>. The licence text below is
reproduced verbatim from <https://www.unicode.org/license.txt>, fetched 2026-10-05; the copyright line is the one that
page carries.

### 2. `ucd/RFC5892-appendix-B.txt` -- IETF Trust Legal Provisions

The code-point table from Appendix B of RFC 5892, "The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized Domain Names for
Applications (IDNA)", P. Faltstrom, Ed., August 2010, Standards Track
(<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892>). The RFC's copyright notice, quoted from the RFC fetched 2026-10-05:

```
Copyright (c) 2010 IETF Trust and the persons identified as the document authors. All rights reserved.

This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust's Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents
(http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of publication of this document. Please review these
documents carefully, as they describe your rights and restrictions with respect to this document. Code Components
extracted from this document must include Simplified BSD License text as described in Section 4.e of the Trust Legal
Provisions and are provided without warranty as described in the Simplified BSD License.
```

SM carries the table unmodified inside the unmodified `json-schema-validator` jar and attributes it here to the IETF Trust
and the authors of RFC 5892. The table is data, not a Code Component, but if it were treated as one, the Simplified BSD
(Revised BSD, `BSD-2-Clause`) licence the Trust Legal Provisions name is on the `REQ-014` allow-list.

## `io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded:1.68.1` (Apache-2.0) embedded BoringSSL

Approved by owner ruling `OR-127` L3 ("including its embedded BoringSSL, with the notice obligations carried in the
distribution's NOTICE"), by exact coordinate and version, added with plan 015 T1.2. The jar's own `META-INF/NOTICE.txt`
(read from the 1.68.1 jar) states: "This product contains code from boringssl. LICENSE (Combination ISC and OpenSSL
license): `license/LICENSE.boringssl.txt`" (homepage <https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/>). The same NOTICE lists
Tomcat Native and the Maven wrapper (Apache-2.0) and a small piece of AIX support code taken from NetBSD under the
OpenSSL License (`license/LICENSE.aix-netbsd.txt`); both travel in the jar. The BoringSSL licence text below is reproduced
verbatim from `META-INF/license/LICENSE.boringssl.txt` in that jar, and the AIX/NetBSD text follows it (T1.2 review finding 9).
**A different version of this artifact fails the build** (`licence-exceptions.txt` carries the exact `1.68.1` line, so
`licence-third-party.ftl` RULE 2 aborts on any other resolved version) until the jar's NOTICE and these texts are re-read and
the line is re-approved.

**Obligation for the release runbook (plan 015 T5.2).** The OpenSSL License's clause 3 requires that "all advertising materials
mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgment: This product includes software developed
by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit"; and clause 2 that binary redistributions reproduce the copyright notice,
conditions and disclaimer in the documentation or other materials provided with the distribution. The distribution's NOTICE must
therefore carry the texts below.

```
BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.
Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
https://cla.developers.google.com/clas
Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.
The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
openssl-core@openssl.org.
The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
record keeping.)
